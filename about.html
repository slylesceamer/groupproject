        Eats on Reserve is a startup non-profit organization driven to provide uneaten and unused leftover food to benefit the less fortunate in need of food. We aim in assisting the charitable communities of all sizes, whether it's the National Red Cross Society, the religious sectors via soup kitchens and public school free meal programs. Our goal is purely simple in aiding the ability of anyone to get a nice meal to consume. A good meal goes a long way to a great day. This is our mission statement and our creed "Everyone's gotta eat so why not you".
